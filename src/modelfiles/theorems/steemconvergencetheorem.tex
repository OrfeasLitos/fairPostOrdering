\begin{theorem}
  The Steem system $\left(\playerlen, \rounds, \postlen, t\right)$-converges if
  and only if $\stpowvec$ is constant and $\rounds - 1 \geq \left(\postlen -
  1\right) \ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}}$.
\end{theorem}

  \paragraph{Discussion}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If players have attention span smaller than the full list and do not
      have the rounds to vote for every post, make a $\postlist$ with the best
      post at the end and it will stay there.
    \end{itemize}
