  We thank Edith Elkind, Professor in the University of Oxford, for her insightful comments and guidance on relevant previous academic work. 
  We also want to acknowledge the help and recommendations from Kousha Etessami in order to prove the convergence bounds of Steem.

  
  We would also like to show our gratitude to Steemit's blogger @jga, Juli\'an Gonz\'alez. His posts~\cite{curationRewards,selfvoters} analyzing Steem internals which successfully complement Steemit's Whitepaper~\cite{steemit} have been of invaluable help for our understanding of the system.
