  We thank Edith Elkind, Professor at the University of Oxford, for her insightful comments and guidance on relevant previous academic work. 
  We also want to acknowledge the help and recommendations from Kousha Etessami, Professor at the University of Edinburgh, in order to prove the convergence bound of Steem.

  We would also like to show our gratitude to Steemit's blogger @jga, Juli\'an Gonz\'alez. His posts~\cite{curationRewards,selfvoters} analyzing Steem internals which successfully complement Steemit's Whitepaper~\cite{steemit} have been of invaluable help for our understanding of the system.
