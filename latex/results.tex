\section{Summary and Future Work}

  We have defined an abstract post-voting system, along with a particularization
  inspired by the Steemit platform. We proved the exact conditions on the
  Steemit system parameters under which it successfully curates arbitrary lists
  of posts. We provided the results of simulations of the execution of the
  voting procedure under various conditions. Both cases with only honest and
  mixed honest and selfish players were simulated. We conclude that the Voting
  Power mechanism of Steem and the fact that self-voting is a profitable
  strategy may hurt curation quality.
