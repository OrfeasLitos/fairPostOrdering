\section{Introduction}
  The modern Internet contains an immense amount of data; a single user can only consume a tiny fraction in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, any widely used platform that hosts user-generated content (UGC) must employ a content curation mechanism.
   Content curation can be understood as the set of mechanisms which rank, aggregate and filter relevant information. In recent years, popular news aggregation sites like Reddit\footnote{\url{https://www.reddit.com/} Accessed: 2018-09-25} or Hacker News\footnote{\url{https://news.ycombinator.com/} Accessed: 2018-09-25} have established crowdsourced curation as the primary way to filter content for their users.
   Crowdsourced content curation, as opposed to more traditional techniques such as expert- or algorithmic-based curation, orders and filters content based on the ratings and feedback of the users themselves, obviating the need for a central moderator by leveraging the ``wisdom of the crowd''~\cite{askalidis2013theoretical}.

  The decentralized nature of crowdsourced curation makes it a suitable solution for ranking user-generated content in blockchain-based content hosting systems. The aggregation and filtering of user-generated content emerges as a particularly challenging problem in permissionless blockchains, as any solution that requires a concrete moderator implies that there exists a privileged party, which is incompatible with a permissionless blockchain.
   Moreover, public blockchains are easy targets for Sybil attacks, as any user can create new accounts at any time for a marginal cost.
    Therefore, on-chain mechanisms to resist the effect of Sybil users are necessary for a healthy and well-functioning platform; traditional counter-Sybil mechanisms~\cite{levine2006survey} are much harder to apply in the case of blockchains due to the decentralized nature of the latter.
   The functions performed by moderators in traditional content platforms need to be replaced by incentive mechanisms that ensure self-regulation. Having the impact of a vote depend on the number of coins the voter holds is an intuitively appealing strategy to achieve a proper alignment of incentives for users in decentralized content platforms; specifically, it can render Sybil attacks impossible.

   However, the correct design of such systems is still an unsolved problem. Blockchains have created a new economic paradigm where users are at the same time equity holders in the system, and leveraging this property in a robust manner constitutes an interesting challenge.
   A variety of projects have designed decentralized content curation systems~\cite{synereo,steemit,tcr}. Nevertheless, a deep understanding of the properties of such systems is still lacking. Among them, Steemit
has a long track record, having been in operation since 2016 and attaining a user base of more than 1.08 M\footnote{\url{https://steemdb.com/accounts} Accessed: 2018-09-25} registered accounts\footnote{The number of accounts should not be understood as the number of active users, as one user can create multiple accounts.}. Steemit is a social media platform which lets users earn money (in the form of the STEEM cryptocurrency) by both creating and curating content in the network. Steemit is the front-end of the social network, a graphical web interface which allows users to see the content of the platform. On the other hand, all the back-end information is stored on a distributed ledger, the Steem blockchain. Steem can be understood as an ``app-chain'', a blockchain with a specific application purpose: serving as a distributed database for social media applications~\cite{steemit}.

In this work we initiate a study of the foundations of decentralized content curation. We develop a theoretical model of a post-voting system which aims to sort the posts created by users in a distributed and crowdsourced manner.
  Our model is constituted by a functionality which executes a protocol performed by $N$ players who have a fixed strategy, but in principle their set of actions could be extended.
   The $N$ players contribute votes in a round-based curation process. The impact of each vote depends on the number of coins held by the player.
   The posts are arranged in a list, sorted by the value of votes received, resembling the front-page model of Reddit or Hacker News. In the model, players vote according to their subjective opinion on the quality of the posts and have a limited attention span.
   Following previous related work, we represent each player's opinion on each post (i.e. likability) with a numerical value $\like \in [ 0,1 ]$~\cite{ghosh2011incentivizing,askalidis2013theoretical}.
   The objective quality of a post will be calculated as the simple summation of all players' likabilities for the post in question. To measure the properties of such a post-voting system, we say that the system \textit{$t$-converges} if the $t$ first articles are ordered according to the objective quality of the posts at the end of the execution.
  After defining and formalizing an abstract post-voting system, we particularize it to model Steemit.
   We prove the conditions under which Steemit $t$-converges and then we develop a simulation to help us parametrize Steemit according to our post-voting model.
   Our analysis of the post-voting system of Steemit aims to provide a useful framework to aid the design of future decentralized curation platforms. \aggelos{This needs more work}
