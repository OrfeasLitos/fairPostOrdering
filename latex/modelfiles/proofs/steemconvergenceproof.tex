\begin{proof}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that
    \begin{gather}
      \label{conv:proof:rev}
      \rounds - 1 \geq \left(\postlen - 1\right)\ceil*{\frac{a+b}{\regen}} \\
      \text{and } \forall i \in \left[\playerlen\right], \stpowvec_i = c
      \enspace. \nonumber
    \end{gather}
    Let $\pid \in \left[\playerlen\right]$. In this case it is $\rounds \geq
    \postlen$ and according to \textsc{VoteThisRound} in
    Algorithm~\ref{alg:steem:vote}, $u_{\pid}$ votes non-null in rounds
    $\left(\round_1, \dots, \round_\postlen\right)$ with $r_i = \floor*{\left(i
    - 1\right)\frac{\rounds - 1}{\postlen - 1}} + 1$. Observe that:
    \begin{gather}
      \label{conv:proof:integer}
      \left(\ref{conv:proof:rev}\right) \Rightarrow \frac{\rounds - 1}{\postlen
      - 1} \geq \ceil*{\frac{a+b}{\regen}}
      \underset{\text{integer}}{\overset{\text{rhs}}{\Rightarrow}}
      \floor*{\frac{\rounds - 1}{\postlen - 1}} \geq \ceil*{\frac{a+b}{\regen}}
      \enspace, \\
      \label{conv:proof:step}
      \forall i \in \left[\postlen\right] \setminus \left\{1\right\}, r_i
      \in \left\{r_{i - 1} + \floor*{\frac{\rounds - 1}{\postlen - 1}}, r_{i -
      1} + \ceil*{\frac{\rounds - 1}{\postlen - 1}}\right\} \enspace.
    \end{gather}
    From (\ref{conv:proof:integer}) and (\ref{conv:proof:step}) we have that
    $\forall i \in \left[\postlen - 1\right], r_{i+1} - r_i \geq
    \ceil*{\frac{a+b}{\regen}}$. We will now prove by induction that $\forall i
    \in \left[\postlen\right], \votpowvec_{\pid, r_i} = 1$.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item For $i = 1, \votpowvec_{\pid, 1} = 1$ by
      (Algorithm~\ref{alg:steem:init}, line~\ref{alg:steem:init:vp}).  \item Let
      $\votpowvec_{\pid, r_i} = 1$. Until $r_{i + 1}$, a single non-null vote is
      cast by $u_\pid$, which reduces $\votpowvec_{\pid}$ by at most $a + b$
      (Algorithm~\ref{alg:steem:handlevote},
      line~\ref{alg:steem:handlevote:cost:start}) and at least $\ceil*{\frac{a +
      b}{\regen}}$ regenerations, each of which replenishes $\votpowvec_{\pid}$
      by $\regen$. Thus
      \begin{equation*}
        \votpowvec_{\pid, r_{i + 1}} \geq \min{\left\{\votpowvec_{\pid, r_i} - a
        - b + \regen\ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}}, 1\right\}} \geq 1 \enspace.
      \end{equation*}
      But $\votpowvec_{\pid}$ cannot exceed 1
      (line~\ref{alg:steem:handlevote:regen}), thus $\votpowvec_{\pid, r_{i +
      1}} = 1$.
    \end{itemize}
    Since the above holds for every $\pid \in \left[\playerlen\right]$, we have
    that at the end of the execution, all votes have been cast with full voting
    power, thus $\forall \post = \left(i, \like\right) \in \postlist_\rounds,
    \mathrm{scores}_{p} = c\left(\playerlen b + a \sum\limits_{\pid =
    1}^\playerlen \like_{\pid}\right)$ and the posts in $\postlist_R$ are sorted
    by decreasing score (Algorithm~\ref{alg:steem:handlevote},
    line~\ref{alg:steem:handlevote:order}). We observe that
    \begin{gather*}
      \forall p_1 = \left(j^1, \like^1\right) \neq p_2 = \left(j^2,
      \like^2\right) \in \postlist_R, \idsc{p_1} > \idsc{p_2} \Rightarrow \\
      \sum\limits_{i = 1}^\playerlen \like^1_i > \sum\limits_{i = 1}^\playerlen
      \like^2_i \Rightarrow c\left(\playerlen b + a \sum\limits_{i =
      1}^\playerlen \like^1_i\right) > c\left(\playerlen b + a \sum\limits_{i =
      1}^\playerlen \like^2_i\right) \enspace.
    \end{gather*}
    Thus all posts will be ordered according to their ideal scores; put
    otherwise, $\textsc{IdealScore}^M\left(\postlist_\rounds\right)$ holds.

    \item ($\stpowvec$ variable $\Rightarrow$ no convergence) Let $\postlist =
    \left(\left(1, \left(a_1, \dots, a_\playerlen\right)\right), \left(2,
    \left(b_1, \dots, b_\playerlen\right)\right)\right)$ such that the following
    linear constraints are simultaneously feasible:
    \begin{gather*}
      \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen a_i > \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen b_i \\
      \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen \stpow_i a_i < \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen
      \stpow_i  b_i
    \end{gather*}
    I think that's always possible if $\stpow$ is not constant.

    \item (inequality doesn't hold $\Rightarrow$ no convergence) Suppose that
    \begin{gather}
      \label{conv:proof:fewrounds}
      \rounds - 1 < \left(\postlen - 1\right)\ceil*{\frac{a+b}{\regen}} \\
      \text{and } \forall i \in \left[\playerlen\right], \stpowvec_i = c
      \enspace. \nonumber
    \end{gather}
    If $\rounds < \postlen$ things are easier TODO: prove this.

    Assume $\rounds \geq \postlen$. In this case, all posts receive a vote by
    all players. Consider $\postlist^1 = 1^{\postlen \times \playerlen}$ and
    $\pid \in \left[\playerlen\right]$. Let
    \begin{equation*}
      i \in \left[\postlen\right] :\left(\votpowvecreg_{\pid, \round_i} < 1
      \wedge \nexists i' < i: \votpowvecreg_{\pid, \round_{i'}} < 1\right)
      \enspace,
    \end{equation*}
    i.e. $i$ is the first round in which $u_\pid$ votes with less than full
    voting power. Since the first round is a voting round and the voting power
    of all players is full, it is $i \geq 2$. Such a round exists for the
    following reason:

    If $\nexists i \in \left[\postlen\right] :\left(\votpowvecreg_{\pid,
    \round_i} < 1 \wedge \nexists i' < i: \votpowvecreg_{\pid, \round_{i'}} <
    1\right)$, then $\forall i \in \left[\postlen\right], \votpowvecreg_{\pid,
    \round_i} = 1 \Rightarrow \forall i \in \left[\postlen\right] \setminus
    \left\{1\right\}, \round_i \geq \round_{i - 1} + \ceil*{\frac{a +
    b}{\regen}}$ to have enough rounds to replenish the voting power after a
    full-weight, full-voting power vote. Thus $\round_\postlen \geq 1 +
    \left(\postlen - 1\right)\ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}} > \rounds$,
    contradiction.

    Since all players follow the same voting pattern, the voting power of all
    players in each round is the same. Let $\mathrm{reducedVP} =
    \votpowvecreg_{1, \round_i}$. For now assume $2 | N$ and $\attspan < i \vee
    i > 2$. TODO: prove rest. Let $0 < \gamma < 1$ and $0 < \epsilon <
    \gamma\left(1 - \mathrm{reducedVP}\right)$.
    \begin{gather*}
      \mathrm{weakPost} = \left(1, \left(\underbrace{1, \dots,
      1}_{\playerlen/2}, \underbrace{\gamma - \epsilon, \dots, \gamma -
      \epsilon}_{\playerlen/2}\right)\right) \enspace, \\
      \mathrm{strongPost} = \left(1, \left(\underbrace{\gamma, \dots,
      \gamma}_{\playerlen/2}, \underbrace{1, \dots,
      1}_{\playerlen/2}\right)\right) \enspace, \\
      \mathrm{nullPost} = \left(1, \left(\underbrace{0, \dots,
      0}_{\playerlen}\right)\right) \enspace, \\
      \postlist = \left[\underbrace{\mathrm{weakPost}, \dots,
      \mathrm{weakPost}}_{i - 1}, \mathrm{strongPost},
      \underbrace{\mathrm{nullPost}, \dots, \mathrm{nullPost}}_{\postlen -
      i}\right] \enspace.
    \end{gather*}

    First of all, it is $\forall j \in \left[i - 1\right],
    \idsc{\postlist\left[j\right]} = \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(1 + \gamma -
    \epsilon\right) < \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(1 + \gamma\right) =
    \idsc{\postlist\left[i\right]}$ and $\forall j \in \left\{i + 1, \dots,
    \postlen\right\}, \idsc{\postlist\left[j\right]} = 0 <
    \idsc{\postlist\left[i\right]}$, thus the strong post has strictly the
    highest ideal score of all posts and as a result, $\forall \postlist'$ that
    contains the same posts as $\postlist$ and
    $\textsc{Ideal}^1\left(\postlist'\right)$ holds, it is
    $\postlist'\left[1\right] = \postlist\left[i\right]$.

    We observe that all players like both weak and strong posts more than null
    posts, thus no player will vote for a null post unless her attention span
    contains only null posts. This can happen in two cases: First, if the player
    has not yet voted for all non-null posts, but the first $\attspan$ posts of
    the list, excluding already voted posts, are null posts. Second, if the
    player has already voted for all non-null posts. For a null post to rank
    higher than a non-null one, it must be true that there exists one player
    that has cast the first vote for the null post. However, since the null
    posts are initially at the bottom of the list and it is impossible for a
    post to improve its ranking before it is voted, we deduce that this first
    vote can be cast only after the voter has voted for all non-null posts. We
    deduce that all players vote for all non-null posts before voting for any
    null post.

    We will now see that the first $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players vote first for
    all weak posts and then for the strong post. These players like the weak
    posts more than the strong post. As we saw, they will not vote any null
    post before voting for all non-null ones. If $\attspan > 1$ they vote for
    the strong post only when all other posts in their attention span are null
    ones and thus they will have voted for all weak posts already. If $\attspan
    = 1$ and since no post can increase its position before being voted, the
    strong post will become ``visible'' for all players only once they have
    voted for all weak posts. Thus in both cases the first
    $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players vote for the strong post only after they have
    voted for all weak posts first.

    The two previous results combined prove that the first
    $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players vote for the strong post in round $\round_i$
    exactly. We also observe that these players have experienced the exact same
    voting power reduction and regeneration as in the case of $\postlist^1$
    since they voted only for posts with likeability 1, thus in round $\round_i$
    their voting power after regeneration is exactly the same as in the case of
    $\postlist^1: \forall \pid \in
    \left[\frac{\playerlen}{2}\right], \votpowvecreg_{\pid, \round_i} =
    \mathrm{reducedVP}$.

    We observe that the first $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players vote for all weak
    posts with full voting power. As for the last $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$
    players, we observe that, if $\attspan < i$, they all vote for the first
    weak post of the list in the first round, and thus with full voting power. If
    $\attspan \geq i$ and $i > 2$, they vote for the strong post in the first
    round and for the first weak post in $r_2$ with full voting power. Thus in
    all cases the last $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players vote for the first weak
    post with full voting power. Therefore, the score of the first weak post at
    the end of the execution is
    $\mathrm{sc}_{\rounds}\left(\postlist\left[1\right]\right) =
    c\left(\frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(a + b\right) +
    \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(\left(\gamma - \epsilon\right) a +
    b\right)\right)$.

    On the other hand, at the end of the execution the strong post has been
    voted by the first $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players with $\mathrm{reducedVP}$
    voting power and by the last $\frac{\playerlen}{2}$ players with at most
    full voting power, thus its final score will be at most
    $\mathrm{sc}_{\rounds}\left(\postlist\left[i\right]\right) \leq
    c\left(\frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(\mathrm{reducedVP} \cdot \gamma a +
    b\right) + \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(a + b\right)\right)$. It is
    \begin{gather*}
      \epsilon < \gamma\left(1 - \mathrm{reducedVP}\right) \Rightarrow \\
      c\left(\frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(a + b\right) +
      \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(\left(\gamma - \epsilon\right) a +
      b\right)\right) < c\left(\frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(\mathrm{reducedVP}
      \cdot \gamma a + \frac{\playerlen}{2}\left(a + b\right)\right)\right)
      \Rightarrow \\
      \mathrm{sc}_{\rounds}\left(\postlist\left[i\right]\right) <
      \mathrm{sc}_{\rounds}\left(\postlist\left[1\right]\right) \enspace.
    \end{gather*}

    Thus $\postlist_{\rounds}\left[1\right] \neq \postlist\left[i\right]$ and
    $\mathrm{Ideal}^1\left(\postlist_{\rounds}\right)$ does not hold.
  \end{itemize}
