\begin{proofsketch}
  When $\stpowvec$ is not constant, we build a post list where the most liked
  post is not preferred by rich players and thus is not placed at the top. For a
  constant $\stpowvec$, when $\rounds - 1 \geq \left(\postlen -
  1\right)\ceil*{\frac{a +b}{\regen}}$, there are enough rounds to ensure full
  regeneration of every player's voting power between two votes and thus the
  resulting post list reflects the true preferences of the players. In the
  opposite case, we can always craft a post list that exploits the fact that
  some votes are cast with reduced voting power in order to trick the system
  into placing a wrong post in the top position.
