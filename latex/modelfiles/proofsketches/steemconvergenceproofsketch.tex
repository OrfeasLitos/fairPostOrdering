\begin{proofsketch}
  When $\rounds - 1 \geq \left(\postlen - 1\right)\ceil*{\frac{a +b}{\regen}}$,
  there are enough rounds to ensure full regeneration of every player's voting
  power between two votes and thus the resulting post list reflects the true
  preferences of the players. In the opposite case, we can always craft a post
  list that exploits the fact that some votes are cast with reduced voting power
  in order to trick the system into placing a wrong post in the top position.
